Problematic:

- Influence de la guerre sur les festivités
- Bal travesti - avant après modèle parisien: https://devisu.inha.fr/modespratiques/117



By using the corpus available in the Impresso app, a digitalise platform of newspapers, and his API, I proposed to dress a panorama of the Carnaval in Luxembourg, mainly in this two main cities Esch and Luxembourg. Looking at the frequentation over the time and the influence of the two period of war. Mapping the place, outside and inside. Visualize the form, bal travesti for example and looking at in a broader chronology to see specificity or not in Luxembourg. Extracting the price of the mask to have a overview of frequentation and social indicator. This view available in a notebook allowing further dataset's exploration.

Impresso:
The first Impresso project was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF CR- SII5_173719) as part of the Sinergia funding programme. It developed a scalable architecture for the processing of Swiss and Luxembourgish newspaper collections and created the [Impresso web application](https://impresso-project.ch/app/) with powerful search, filter, and discovery functionalities based on semantic enrichments which targeted the historical research community at-large. To learn more about the first Impresso project and its outputs,

## With Claude

Here's a revised 250-word abstract that incorporates the key elements while emphasizing the digital humanities methodology and reproducible research aspects:

Title: Mapping Luxembourg's Carnival Culture: A Digital Analysis Through Historical Newspapers (1880-1940)

This research leverages digital humanities methods to analyze the evolution of carnival celebrations in Luxembourg's main urban centers, Esch and Luxembourg City, through the lens of digitized historical newspapers. Using the Impresso platform's extensive newspaper corpus and API, we conduct a systematic examination of carnival practices from 1880 to 1940, with particular attention to the impact of both World Wars on these cultural celebrations.

Our methodology combines computational analysis with historical investigation, implemented through Jupyter notebooks that ensure full reproducibility of our research. We analyze geographical distributions, mapping both outdoor and indoor celebration venues, and track the evolution of different carnival formats, particularly the "bal travesti" (masquerade balls). The study also examines economic aspects by tracking mask prices as indicators of social accessibility and participation levels.

The research workflow is entirely open-source and documented in interactive notebooks, allowing other researchers to verify, reuse, and build upon our findings. By extracting and analyzing data from Luxembourg's historical press, we offer new insights into the spatial, temporal, and social dimensions of carnival celebrations. This computational approach to cultural history demonstrates how digital tools can enhance our understanding of traditional festivities while maintaining methodological transparency.

The study not only contributes to Luxembourg's cultural history but also serves as a model for reproducible research in digital humanities, combining traditional historical analysis with modern computational methods.

## What can we analyse

**Content Analysis Possibilities:**

1. **Representation & Language**
    - How did newspapers describe carnival events?
    - How did the tone of coverage change over time?
2. **Event Coverage**
    - Which events received the most press coverage?
    - How detailed were the descriptions of costumes and masks?
3. **Social Commentary**
    - How did newspapers report on behavior and public order during carnival?
    - What critiques or controversies were reported?
    - How were different social groups portrayed in carnival coverage?
4. **Practical Information**
    - Prices (tickets, masks, costumes)
    - Venues and their evolution
    - Timing of events
    - Transportation arrangements
    - Organization committees
5. **Advertisements**
    - What kinds of carnival-related products were advertised?
    - Which shops and venues promoted carnival events?
    - How did commercial aspects of carnival evolve?

These questions could be investigated through:

- Text mining and frequency analysis
- Named entity recognition (places, organizations)
- Price tracking over time
- Network analysis of venues and organizers
- Mapping mentions of locations
- Temporal analysis of carnival season coverage


## Last version

Title: Digital Exploration of Luxembourg's Carnival Culture: A Data-Driven Analysis Through Historical Press (1880-1940)

This research harnesses digital humanities methodologies to investigate the evolution of carnival celebrations in Luxembourg, focusing on its two main urban centers: Luxembourg City and Esch-sur-Alzette. Using the Impresso platform's digitized newspaper corpus and API, we conduct a multifaceted analysis of carnival practices from 1880 to 1940, examining both their cultural significance and transformation during the World Wars.

Through computational text analysis and data visualization, we explore how newspapers portrayed carnival events, tracking changes in language use, tone, and coverage patterns. Our investigation encompasses multiple dimensions: spatial mapping of indoor and outdoor venues, social dynamics reflected in mask and ticket prices, and the evolution of specific carnival formats like the "bal travesti." Special attention is given to how different social groups were represented and how newspapers reported on public order and social behaviors during festivities.

The study combines various digital methods including text mining, named entity recognition, and temporal analysis to extract and visualize patterns in carnival coverage. We track commercial aspects through advertisement analysis and examine how organizational structures evolved through network analysis of venues and committees.

Our research workflow is implemented through Jupyter notebooks, ensuring full reproducibility and enabling other researchers to explore the dataset further. This computational approach not only provides new insights into Luxembourg's carnival traditions but also demonstrates how digital tools can enhance our understanding of historical cultural practices.

## The version more humble

Title: Exploring Luxembourg's Carnival through Digital Press Archives: A Case Study of Luxembourg City and Esch (1880-1970)

This research proposes to examine carnival celebrations in Luxembourg's two main urban centers through the lens of digitized historical newspapers, using the Impresso (https://impresso-project.ch/) platform's corpus and API. Our study aims to understand how carnival practices were reported and evolved in Luxembourg City and Esch-sur-Alzette, with particular attention to the period spanning both World Wars.

By analyzing newspaper coverage, we will investigate several aspects of carnival culture: the types of events that received press attention, their locations (both indoor and outdoor venues), and their social accessibility as reflected in mask and ticket prices. The study will also explore how newspapers depicted different social groups and reported on public behavior during festivities.

Our methodology combines basic text analysis with geographical mapping to track mentions of venues, events, and prices. Special attention will be given to specific carnival formats like the "bal travesti" and their evolution over time. We will also examine how commercial aspects of carnival were presented through advertisement analysis.

The research will be conducted using Jupyter notebooks, making our methodology transparent and allowing other researchers to verify and build upon our findings. Through this initial exploration of Luxembourg's carnival traditions, we hope to contribute to our understanding of this important cultural practice while testing the potential of digital newspaper archives for cultural historical research.
