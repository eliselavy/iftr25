The IFTR Working Group Digital Humanities in Theatre Research will meet in Cologne, Germany (9 – 13 June 2025), and we warmly invite all members as well as new participants to submit their abstracts. Abstracts (up to 250 words, in English) are due on January 15, 2025. Please note the rather early deadline!
All abstract submissions are made through the Cambridge Core website indicating that you wish your proposal to be considered by the Digital Humanities working group: https://www.cambridge.org/core/membership/iftr/. Please note that in order to make a submission you will need to become a member of IFTR. Working groups are not required to address the theme of the IFTR conference – Performing Carnival: Ekstasis, Subversion, Metamorphosis – but papers which enter into conversation with the 2025 IFTR theme are most welcome.
We are soliciting papers and project presentations that apply digital and computational methodologies to the study of theatre and performance. We are especially interested in topics that:

elaborate on best practices for digital humanities projects in theatre and performance, digital theatre history and historiography
describe the creation, the modeling process, the management or preservation of theatre records in the form of databases, archives and repositories
examine the theoretical implications of Digital Humanities for our research in theatre and performance as well as theatre historiography
apply digital and computational methods to study any aspect of theatrical phenomena (such as sociological, aesthetic, technical, historic, cultural, and political aspects)
use data from social media and other online sources to study the creation, promotion and reception of performances
critically engage with or apply forms of data analysis, data visualization, Virtual or Augmented Reality (VR/AR) and/or machine learning 
Please make use of our two different formats of participation and indicate your choice in the comments when submitting your abstract:
a) 20-minutes presentation of a project or research question, which will be followed by 10 minutes of discussion
OR
b) circulating papers/materials in advance, with a 10-minutes presentation, followed by 20 minutes of discussion
In order to enhance the discussions during the WG meetings, we ask all presenters who want to pre-circulate their materials to do so by May 12, 2025. These materials can take the form of an academic paper (max. 3000 words long), a website, tools, videos, datasets, or any other digital objects. At the conference, the scholars will be given 10 minutes to introduce their work, which will be followed by 20 minutes of discussion.
Please consider forwarding this call for papers to colleagues and PhD-students connected to the field of DH & theatre/performance studies. We very much look forward to receiving your abstracts and hopefully seeing many of you in Cologne in 2025!

Best wishes,
The Convenors of the DH Working Group
